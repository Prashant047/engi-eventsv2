                <p>Do you spend lectures doodling in your notebook and have a knack for bringing to life with those

                    creativity? Lose yourself and drown in the colours of the world. Create that which cannot be
                    explained but only experienced. An artist would not be an artist if the world appeared normal.
                    With a plethora of unique competitions like 3-D Painting, Doodling, Sketching, Painting and
